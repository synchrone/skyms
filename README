This is a cloud-based skype messaging gateway service.
It can send messages with urlencoded text to a BLOB-identified Skype conversation, which can be very useful for deployment announcements, bug reports, etc.

Requirements:
1) SkypeKit SDK (only 2 python files are needed from there)
2) SkypeKit Runtime (generated on a per-user basis)
3) Your http://developer.skype.com/account/projects
all available from http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/releases/skypekit-3-7-0 after a 5$ registration fee

Installation:
1) Modify skyms/settings.py to reflect your skype account and SkypeKit certificate,
2) Place your skypekit.py and Skype.py from <skypekitsdk>/ipc/python and <skypekitsdk>/interfaces/skype/python respectively to skypekit directory
3) Place SkypeKit Runtime binary named <os>-<arch>-skypekit-novideo (e.g. linux-x86-skypekit-novideo) to skypekit folder and set chmod +x on it
4) `dotcloud push <your_service_name>`

Check if everything went OK with `dotcloud logs <your_service_name>.www` command

The code can be considered beerware ;)
