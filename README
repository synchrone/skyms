This is a cloud-based skype messaging gateway service.
It can send messages with urlencoded text to a BLOB-identified Skype conversation, which can be very useful for deployment announcements, bug reports, etc.

Requirements:
1) SkypeKit SDK (only 2 python files are needed from there) and Runtime (http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/releases/skypekit-3-7-hf1/download)
2) Your client certificate for usage with skypekit runtime (http://developer.skype.com/account/projects)

Installation:
1) Modify skyms/settings.py to reflect your skype account and SkypeKit certificate path,
2) Place your skypekit.py and Skype.py from <skypekitsdk>/ipc/python and <skypekitsdk>/interfaces/skype/python respectively to skypekit directory
3) Place SkypeKit Runtime binary named <os>-<arch>-skypekit-novideo (e.g. linux-x86-skypekit-novideo) to skypekit directory and set chmod +x on it
4) Place your client certificate to skypekit directory
5) `dotcloud push --all <your_service_name>` (all to push your changes, not my generic repo version)

Check if everything went OK with `dotcloud logs <your_service_name>.www` command

The code can be considered beerware ;)
